For this section I think it suffices to only talk about the probability of seeing a specific card from a deck draw. This would be a good segway for them the practice their python on drawing a card from a deck. The python file is named the randomCardGenerator.py. I would include some of the code with '...' as in data8 and allow the students to fill in the blanks. Have them generate a histogram of the probability of seeing each card (or only a subset). Mention that the probability should be uniform, etc."

If you'd like, you can include binomial and poisson as a bonus for those students who are more advance, but I would personally include them as stand alone sections that the presenter wouldn't have to go through. There are equations and examples already in the Distributions.ipynb found in /notebooks/machine_learning/Naive_Bayes."

I would recommend writing the code in a \"fill in the blanks\" format to not confuse students too much. Have them play with different means and standard devations to get a feel for the process. Also, suggest they talk to friends."
