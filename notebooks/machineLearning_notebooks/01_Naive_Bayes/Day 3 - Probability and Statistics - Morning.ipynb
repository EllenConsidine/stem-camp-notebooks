    "First off, you all may have heard of the mean value of a set of data, but if not, the \"mean\" is simply the average. Suppose you're given the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 5,3,7,4,2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is their average? We can compute this by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 5 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 2 \\right)  = \\frac{21}{5} = 4.2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine while we have a small set of values, but what if we heard thousands of values, or even hundreds of thousands? This is where computers can be very handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the concept of a \"middle value\" is often better done with the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), which is the number such that half of the data set is above, and half is below. The median is more *robust* than the mean -- for example, if you were typing $ 5,3,7,4,2 $ into your computer, but forgot a comma and typed $ 5,3,7,42 $ instead, the mean of $ 5,3,7,42 $ is $14.25$, which is very different than $4.2$.  However, the median of $ 5,3,7,42 $ is 6, which is close to 4 (the median of $ 5,3,7,4,2 $).  For example, to get a sense of \"typical\" housing prices, median housing price is used instead of mean housing price, otherwise a single \\$10 million mansion will skew the whole dataset.\n",

As you could imagine, our measurements would be slightly off. However, it's reasonable to think that if we took many measurements, that the mean measurement would be pretty close to the true height! In this case, the standard deviation would be a measure of the \"spread\" of all our (potentially) inaccurate measurements around the average (or mean) height. \n",
