    "TODO: DO NOT go through the nitty gritty details of Naive Bayes and Bayes law. We noticed that many students were confused by the equations. Derek and I (Jessica) derived the probability of switching doors and not only did we fumble with the calculation, but the students were clearly lost. Therefore I suggest we talk about the concept and problem here and give some intuition. The idea is to introduce them to a new concept and make probability fun for them. The Naive_Bayes script may be useful here. We used the Computer Science department's script; however, we did not ask ahead of time so I suggest we rewrite most of it ourselves. "
