    "First off, you all may have heard of the mean value of a set of data, but if not, the \"mean\" is simply the average. Suppose you're given the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 5,3,7,4,2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is their average? We can compute this by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 5 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 2 \\right)  = \\frac{21}{5} = 4.2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine while we have a small set of values, but what if we heard thousands of values, or even hundreds of thousands? This is where computers can be very handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the concept of a \"middle value\" is often better done with the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), which is the number such that half of the data set is above, and half is below. The median is more *robust* than the mean -- for example, if you were typing $ 5,3,7,4,2 $ into your computer, but forgot a comma and typed $ 5,3,7,42 $ instead, the mean of $ 5,3,7,42 $ is $14.25$, which is very different than $4.2$.  However, the median of $ 5,3,7,42 $ is 6, which is close to 4 (the median of $ 5,3,7,4,2 $).  For example, to get a sense of \"typical\" housing prices, median housing price is used instead of mean housing price, otherwise a single \\$10 million mansion will skew the whole dataset.\n",

As you could imagine, our measurements would be slightly off. However, it's reasonable to think that if we took many measurements, that the mean measurement would be pretty close to the true height! In this case, the standard deviation would be a measure of the \"spread\" of all our (potentially) inaccurate measurements around the average (or mean) height. \n",

    "Informally, we say that two variables are **independent** if they have nothing to do with each other. For example, if x is the number of fish caught in the Pacific Ocean last year, and y is the number of videos on youtube last year, then x and y are independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If variables are not independent, we call them **dependent**.  If two variables are **correlated**, then they are dependent (and almost vice-versa: if they are dependent, then are often, but not always correlated. Phrased another way, if variables are uncorrelated, then in some cases, such as for Gaussian variables, they are independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive correlation means that if variable x is high (above its mean), then variable y is likely to be high too; and if x is low, then y is likely to be low too.  Correlation is symmetric in the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative correlation means that if x is high, then y is likely to be low, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causation** is the idea that one variable controls the other. For example, the amount of money I spend on ice cream is correlated with the amount of money I earn from my job, but the causation is one-way (not symmetric). That is, if I earn more or less money from my job, I have more or less money to spend on ice cream.  But if I eat more ice cream, that does *not* mean that I will earn more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The false idea that \"correlation means causation\" is one of the biggest fallacies in science, and in machine learning as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence must be taken into account when doing things like surveys. For example, suppose I want to find out what percentage of people in the US are literate. I can send out a survey to everyone's house, ask if they are literate or not, and record the results. Of course, my results will tell me that 100\\% of people are literate, because my survey suffers from extreme **selection-bias**: a very particular type of people are more likely to respond to the survey."
