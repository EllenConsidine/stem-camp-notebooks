# Notebooks for the Data Science Camp

For STEM Camp, there are many Jupyter Notebooks that contain interesting lecture content on a variety of data science and machine learning topics. The following sections explain each set of Notebooks.

## [Twenty Questions](./20Q)

The [`./20Q`](./20Q) notebook directory contains notebooks and datasets for training a decisicion tree to play a "20 Questions" game.

## [Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science](./data8)

[Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org/) is a course offered in partnership with the [Berkeley Division of Data Sciences](https://data.berkeley.edu/). As apart of the open source course materials, several high-quality Jupyter notebooks were released. We have copied several of these notebooks to the [`./data8`](./data8) directory. Specifically, there are:

- 10 Labs
- 3 projects

The labs range in difficulty from first learning how to navigate Jupyter Notebooks to various probability and statistics objectives. The projects are not freebies and they each require independent effort in areas like data visualization and classification.

## [IMDB](./IMDB)

The [`./IMDB`](./IMDB) directory contains a short Notebook which fetches IMDB data and renders a histogram by genre. This is a quick Notebook to go through but the data may take a little bit of time to download.

## [Machine Learning](./machine_learning)

In the [`./machine_learning`](./machine_learning) subdirectory, there are intro notebooks on things like classifiers, regression, distributions, etc.

Some specific algorithms that are covered are:

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Ascent

## [Natural Language Processing](./nlp)

The [`./nlp`](./nlp) subdirectory contains some content which introduces students to several different modern natural language processing tools and techniques. The Notebook content in this module contains introductions to some of the following topics:

- [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/)
- word embeddings
- natural language processing via vector arithmetic
- semantic classification via logistic regression
- and more!

## [Quick Reference](./quick_reference)

The [Quick Reference Notebook](./quick_reference/quick_reference.ipynb) contains handy references for a varitey of syntax tips and tricks. General Python tips are included as well as numeric Python syntax reminders!
